# Algorithm Visualizer

**Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive platform designed to help learners understand the underlying mechanics of popular algorithms, including sorting, searching, graph traversal, and recursion-based problems.  
The project is built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**, offering a fast, modern, and responsive development experience.
